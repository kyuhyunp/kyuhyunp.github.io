## Rules
### Minimize context switching
- Send less messages back and forth
- Work on detailed requirement before coding

### Doing pull request well and save time
- Stacking well by dividing up the task in order
- Commit one functionality at a time with 100 lines of edit or less
- Add many unit test cases of about 400 - 500 lines

### Don't approve the code if you are not confident with it
